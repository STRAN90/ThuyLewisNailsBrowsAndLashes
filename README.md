# Thuy Lewis Nails Brows & Lashes

## Project Overview 

**Thuy Lewis Nails Brows & Lashes**  B2C website showcasing an experienced beauty business located in Bridgend - South Wales. Thuy Lewis specialises in brows, lashes and creative nail designs using different techniques. 

I have designed the website to look professional with a weeding colour scheme as it is the main focus of the business. It is designed to be fully responsive and accessible on a range of devices, making it easy to navigate for potential and existing customers.

The goal of the website is to provide an up-to-date pictures portfolio (creative nail designs, brow and lash transformations), information about the services it delivers, and also allow an easy way for getting in touch with the business owner.

The site must meet all the requirements and goals as potential visitors will most likely be comparing other similar local services, so the final website look must stand out and show everything the user would want to see.
