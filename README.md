## Project Overview 

**Thuy Lewis Nails Brows & Lashes**  B2C website showcasing an experienced beauty business located in Bridgend - South Wales. Thuy Lewis specialises in brows, lashes and creative nail designs using different techniques. 

I have designed the website to look professional as its main focus. It is designed to be fully responsive and accessible on a range of devices, making it easy to navigate for potential and existing customers.

The goal of the website is to provide an up-to-date picture portfolio (creative nail designs, brow and lash transformations), information about the services it delivers, and also allow an easy way for getting in touch with the business owner.

The site must meet all the requirements and goals as potential visitors will most likely be comparing other similar local services, so the final website look must stand out and show everything the user would want to see.

- 1440px - desktop size,
- 1950px - desktop large size.

## Design

### Colour Scheme

The website uses light pastel colours, I wanted to choose colours to reflect the creative personality of the business owner and the hero image used in the home page. 

### Typography

- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)

  - Used 'Roboto': "light 300" font for the website as it great for accessibility.

### Imagery

Wireframes were created for mobile, tablet and desktop. 

### Features

The website is composed of four pages, each is accessible from the navigation menu (home page, treatments, gallery & contact page). 

All pages on the website have:

-A responsive navigation bar at the top which allows the user to navigate through the site. 

-A footer which contains social media links to Facebook and Instagram. Icons were used to keep the footer clean and because they are universally recognisable. 

* Home Page. 
  * Hero Section. 
  The hero shows an image of a popular nail design liked by clients. 
  * About Section.
  This gives users information of Thuy Lewis. On large screens an image of Thuy Lewis in action is seen and laid out in a row. However no image is seen on mobile device. 
  * Testimonials Section
  This section gives reviews from clients. On mobile these are stacked vertically, however on larger screens there can be seen an extra review and set out in rows of twos. 
  * Treatments Section
  This section shows images of treatments and a table of list of treatments. On mobile screen they are stacked vertically, however on larger screens the images are on the right side of the table of treatments. 

* Treatment Page. 
  * Hero Section. 
  The hero shows an image of a salon area. 
  * A Table of treatments and pricelist.

* Gallery Page. 
  * A different variety of current nail designs to showcase Thuy Lewis skills, including eyebrows and lashes. Two more images can be seen on the desktop browser. 

* Contact Page. 
  * A number of ways to get in touch with Thuy Lewis, address, email and phone number. 
  * Opening times. 
  * Contact form Section 
  Form to contact the business owner and map image of location of business. The form contains fields for the users name, email address, phone number and personal message they want to send to the business owner. The user submits the form using the submit button. Users must fill in the name, email, and text area fields to be able to submit the form. If they don't a tooltip will guide them to fill in any information they have missed.
  

### Future Implementations.

  * Slideshow image reel for gallery page. 
  * Send email notification to user once form has been submitted. 
  * Add favicon to website. 

### Accessibility 

I have been mindful during coding to ensure the website is as accessible friendly as possible. I have achieved this by:

* Using semantic HTML.
* Using descriptive alt attributes on images on the site. 
* Ensuring there are sufficient colour contrast throughout the site.
* Using font style with good accessibility.

Each device has been inspected using Google Chrome developer to ensure each page is fully responsive on a variety of different screen sizes and devices. I have also physically tested the responsiveness of the site on a number of different devices.

### W3C Validator

The W3C validator was used to validate the HTML on all pages of the website. It was also used to validate CSS in the style.css file.

* [Index Page HTML](README.docs/Readme/html_index.png)
* [Treatments Page HTML](README.docs/Readme/html_treatments.png)
* [Gallery Page HTML](README.docs/Readme/html_treatments.png)
* [Contact Page HTML](README.docs/Readme/html_treatments.png)
* [W3C CSS Validator](README.docs/Readme/w3c_css_validator.png)

### Lighthouse

I used lighthouse to test each of the pages for:

- Performance - how the page performs whilst loading.
- Accessibility - how accessible is the site for all users and how can it be improved.
- Best practices - how does the site conform to industry best practices.
- SEO - search engine optimization. Is the site optimized for search engine result rankings.

Results can be accessed by this [link](https://pagespeed.web.dev/analysis/https-stran90-github-io-ThuyLewisNailsBrowsAndLashes/pvzas4fdj3?form_factor=mobile)

### Wave

I used wave (web accessibility evaluation tool) in chrome developer tools to test the website accessibility. Scanned website for on-page and technical accessibility issues and errors to bring site in line with recognized accessibility standards, like the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG).

### Bugs

The following issues were raised during my mid project meeting with my mentor:
- Duplicate contact form on homepage and contact page.  

I removed this as if future bugs were to occur in this part of the code, there is a more likely chance of forgetting the dupicate code of the other html page and not fixing it. Saves time and future headwork. 

- Be consistent with choice of colour code.  

HEX was chosen colour code as it was easier and traditional to code and included the alpha parameter.

### Solved Bugs

1. Bug: Nav bar aligned to the right. 
   Fixed: Changed .mr-2 to .ml-auto

2. Error: Bad value 100% for attribute width on element img: Expected a digit but saw % instead.
  From line 39, column 17; to line 39, column 147

          <img src="assets/css/images/Homepage/hero_image.jpg" class="hero-image" alt="finished french style rainbow tip nails" width="100%"↩

Fix: Removing width from img element in index.html and setting CSS rule of width=100% to hero-image class attribute in the style.css. 

3. Error: Bad value 100% for attribute width on element img: Expected a digit but saw % instead.

From line 65, column 25; to line 65, column 125

          <img src="assets/css/images/Homepage/in_action.jpg" alt="Photo of Thuy Lewis in action" width="100%">↩  

Fix: Removing width from img element in index.html and setting CSS rule of width=100% to thuy-lewis id attribute in the style.css.
