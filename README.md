## Project Overview 

**Thuy Lewis Nails Brows & Lashes**  B2C website showcasing an experienced beauty business located in Bridgend - South Wales. Thuy Lewis specialises in brows, lashes and creative nail designs using different techniques. 

I have designed the website to look professional as its main focus. It is designed to be fully responsive and accessible on a range of devices, making it easy to navigate for potential and existing customers.

The goal of the website is to provide an up-to-date pictures portfolio (creative nail designs, brow and lash transformations), information about the services it delivers, and also allow an easy way for getting in touch with the business owner.

The site must meet all the requirements and goals as potential visitors will most likely be comparing other similar local services, so the final website look must stand out and show everything the user would want to see.

- 1440px - desktop size,
- 1950px - desktop large size.

## Design

### Colour Scheme

The website uses light pastel colours, I wanted to choose colours to reflect the creative personality of the business owner and the hero image used in the home page. 

### Typography

- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)

  - Used 'Roboto': "light 300" font for the website as it great for accessibilty.

### Imagery

Wireframes were created for mobile, tablet and desktop. 

### Features

The website is comprised of four pages, each is accessible from the navigation menu (home page, treatments, gallery & contact page). 

All pages on the website have:

A responsive navigation bar at the top which allows the user to navigate through the site. 

A footer which contains social media links to facebook and instagram. Icons were used to keep the footer clean and because they are universally recognisable. 

* Home Page. 
  * Hero Section. 
  The hero shows an image of a popular nail design liked by clients. 
  * About Section.
  This gives users information of Thuy Lewis. On large screens an image of Thuy Lewis in action is seen and laid out in a row. However no image is seen on mobile device. 
  * Testimonials Section
  This section gives reviews from clients. On mobile these are stacked vertically, however on larger screens there can be seen an extra review and set out in rows of twos. 
  * Treatments Section
  This section shows images of treatments and a table of list of treatments. On mobile screen they are stacked vertically, however on larger screens the images are on the right side of the table of treatments. 

* Treatment Page. 
  * A Table of treatments and pricelist.

* Gallery Page. 
  * A different variety of current nail designs to showcase Thuy Lewis skills, including eyebrows and lashes. Two more images can be seen on the desktop browser. 

* Contact Page. 
  * A number of ways to get in touch with Thuy Lewis, address, email and phone number. 
  * Opening times. 
  * Contact form Section 
  Form to contact the business owner and map image of loaction of business. The form contains fields for the users name, email address, phone number and personal message they want to send to the business owner. The user submits the form using the submit button. Users must fill in the name, email, and text area fields to be able to submit the form. If they don't a tooltip will guide them to fill in any information they have missed.
  

### Future Implementations.

  * Slideshow image reel for gallery page. 
  * Send email notification to user once form has been submitted. 
  * Add favicon to website. 

### Accessibility 

I have been mindful during coding to ensure the website is as accessable friendly as possible. I have achieved this by:

* Using semantic HTML.
* Using descriptive alt attributes on images on the site. 
* Ensuring there are sufficient colour contrast throughout the site.
* Using font style with good accessibilty.
